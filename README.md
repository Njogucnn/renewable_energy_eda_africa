# Renewable Energy in Africa: Exploratory Data Analysis (2000–2023)

This project explores trends in renewable energy production across African countries using World Bank data from 2000 to 2023. The goal is to analyze renewable energy patterns by country, region, and over time.

## 📁 Datasets Used

1. `renewable_energy_clean.csv` – Total renewable energy generation per country and year.
2. `african_countries_with_regions.csv` – Country-to-region mapping within Africa.
3. `population.csv` – Population data per country and year (merged during cleaning).
